**Deep unfolding** with NOMA refers to applying deep unfolding to optimize signal detection or resource allocation in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems. The iterative receiver or allocation algorithm  is unfolded into a neural network where each iteration is a trainable layer. 

**Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA)** is an optimization algorithm that maximizes an objective function under constraints by iteratively moving along the gradient direction and then projecting the result back onto the feasible region defined by the constraints.

This repository contains code to compare Deep Unfolding and Projected Gradient Ascent (PGA) and plots:
